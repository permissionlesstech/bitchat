# All Privacy Recommendations Completed! üéâ

## Overview

This document celebrates the completion of **ALL THREE** privacy recommendations from the BitChat privacy assessment! Each feature has been implemented with comprehensive functionality, testing, and user controls.

## ‚úÖ **Completed Privacy Features**

### 1. üîí **Low-Visibility Mode** - COMPLETED
**Recommendation**: "Expose a 'low-visibility mode' to reduce scanning aggressiveness in sensitive contexts."

**Implementation**: 
- Reduces active scanning time by 75% (5s‚Üí2s active, 10s‚Üí30s inactive)
- Reduces announce frequency by 50-75% (1-4s‚Üí8s intervals)
- Reduces connection footprint by 50% (6‚Üí3 max connections)
- No duplicate scanning in privacy mode

**User Control**: Toggle in Privacy section of AppInfoView

### 2. üåê **User-Configurable Nostr Relay Set** - COMPLETED
**Recommendation**: "Allow user-configurable Nostr relay set with a 'private relays only' toggle."

**Implementation**:
- Relay categories: Public, Private, Trusted
- Selection modes: All, Private Only, Trusted Only, Custom
- Personal trusted relay management
- Automatic relay filtering and reconnection

**User Control**: Comprehensive relay preferences interface

### 3. üìö **Coalesced READ Behavior** - COMPLETED
**Recommendation**: "Add optional coalesced READ behavior for large backlogs."

**Implementation**:
- Reduces metadata exposure when entering chats with many unread messages
- Only sends read receipt for the latest message when threshold is met
- Marks all messages as read locally without additional receipts
- Configurable threshold (default: 2+ messages)

**User Control**: Toggle in Privacy section of AppInfoView

## üéØ **Privacy Impact Summary**

### **Metadata Reduction**
- **Bluetooth Scanning**: 75% reduction in active scanning time
- **Announce Frequency**: 50-75% reduction in announce frequency
- **Connection Footprint**: 50% reduction in max connections
