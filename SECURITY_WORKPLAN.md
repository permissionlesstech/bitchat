# SECURITY_WORKPLAN â€” ASP Mesh Hardening

## Goals
- Implement rotating static keys (X25519) and master identity (Ed25519)
- Add salted/truncated IDs and epoch salts
- Implement Hop-MAC per link
- Replace naive flooding with probabilistic epidemic routing (p, k)
- Salted Bloom dedupe + LRU exact cache
- Fragmentation and robust reassembly (BLE-friendly)
- Key rotation & revocation flows
- Session rekey policies and expiry
- UX: QR/SAS verification + emergency wipe
