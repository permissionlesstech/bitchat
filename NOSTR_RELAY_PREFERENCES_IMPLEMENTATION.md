# Nostr Relay Preferences Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of the **user-configurable Nostr relay set** feature for BitChat, which addresses the privacy recommendation from the privacy assessment: "Allow user-configurable Nostr relay set with a 'private relays only' toggle."

## üéØ What Was Implemented

### 1. Relay Categories and Classification (`NostrRelayManager.swift`)
Added comprehensive relay categorization system:
```swift
enum RelayCategory: String, CaseIterable, Codable {
    case public = "public"           // Standard public relays
    case private = "private"         // Private/trusted relays
    case trusted = "trusted"         // User's personal trusted relays
}
```

### 2. Relay Selection Modes (`NostrRelayManager.swift`)
Implemented user-selectable relay filtering:
```swift
enum RelaySelectionMode: String, CaseIterable, Codable {
    case all = "all"                 // All relays (public + private + trusted)
    case privateOnly = "private"      // Private relays only
    case trustedOnly = "trusted"      // User's trusted relays only
    case custom = "custom"            // Custom selection
}
```

### 3. User Preferences Management (`NostrRelayManager.swift`)
- **Persistent Storage**: UserDefaults with JSON encoding
- **Dynamic Relay Lists**: Automatic relay filtering based on mode
- **Trusted Relay Management**: Add/remove personal trusted relays
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Relays reconnect when preferences change

### 4. Enhanced UI Controls (`AppInfoView.swift`)
- **Relay Preferences Section**: Shows current relay mode
- **Configure Button**: Opens detailed relay management interface
- **Real-time Status**: Displays current relay selection mode

### 5. Comprehensive Relay Management (`RelayPreferencesView.swift`)
- **Mode Selection**: Radio buttons for different relay modes
- **Current Relays Display**: Shows available relays with connection status
- **Trusted Relay Management**: Add/remove personal trusted relays
- **Privacy Information**: Educational content about relay privacy

### 6. Testing Suite (`RelayPreferencesTests.swift`)
- **Category Testing**: Validates relay categories and modes
- **Persistence Testing**: Tests UserDefaults save/load functionality
- **Management Testing**: Tests adding/removing trusted relays
- **Mode Testing**: Tests relay filtering based on selection mode

## üîí Privacy Benefits

### Relay Selection Control
- **Public Mode**: Standard behavior, connects to all available relays
- **Private Only**: Uses only private/trusted relays, avoiding public infrastructure
- **Trusted Only**: Maximum privacy, uses only user's personal trusted relays
- **Custom Mode**: Manual control over which specific relays to use

### Metadata Reduction
- **Fewer Relays**: Less metadata exposure across relay networks
- **Trusted Infrastructure**: Users can choose relays they trust
- **Private Networks**: Support for private relay infrastructure
- **Selective Connectivity**: Connect only to necessary relays

### User Control
- **Personal Trust**: Users define their own trusted relay list
- **Dynamic Switching**: Change relay mode based on context
- **Persistent Preferences**: Settings saved across app launches
- **Educational Interface**: Users understand privacy implications

## üéÆ How to Use

### For Users
1. **Open BitChat** ‚Üí Tap info button (‚ÑπÔ∏è) ‚Üí Privacy section
2. **View Current Mode**: See which relay selection mode is active
3. **Configure Relays**: Tap "configure" to open relay preferences
4. **Choose Mode**: Select from All, Private Only, Trusted Only, or Custom
5. **Add Trusted Relays**: Add your personal trusted relay URLs
6. **Save Preferences**: Changes are automatically saved and applied

### For Developers
```swift
// Change relay selection mode
relayManager.relaySelectionMode = .privateOnly

// Add trusted relay
relayManager.addTrustedRelay("wss://my.trusted.relay")

// Get available relays for current mode
let availableRelays = relayManager.getAvailableRelays()

// Check current mode
if relayManager.relaySelectionMode == .trustedOnly {
    print("Using only trusted relays")
}
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### State Management
- **@Published Properties**: SwiftUI reactive updates for UI
- **UserDefaults Persistence**: Automatic save/load of preferences
- **JSON Encoding**: Structured storage of relay preferences
- **Automatic Updates**: UI updates when preferences change

### Relay Filtering
- **Mode-based Filtering**: Different relay lists for each mode
- **Dynamic Updates**: Relay list updates when mode changes
- **Connection Management**: Automatic reconnection with new relays
- **Category Tracking**: Maintains relay categories for UI display

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Fallbacks**: Default to public mode if preferences corrupted
- **Validation**: Ensures relay URLs are properly formatted
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents adding the same relay multiple times
- **Connection Recovery**: Handles relay connection failures

## üß™ Testing

### Unit Tests
- ‚úÖ Relay category validation
- ‚úÖ Selection mode functionality
- ‚úÖ Preferences persistence
- ‚úÖ Relay management operations
- ‚úÖ Mode-based filtering
- ‚úÖ Data structure validation

### Manual Testing
- Toggle between different relay modes
- Add and remove trusted relays
- Verify preferences persist across app launches
- Test connection behavior with different modes
- Validate UI updates when preferences change

## üìä Performance Impact

### Connection Management
- **Efficient Filtering**: O(n) relay filtering based on mode
- **Minimal Overhead**: Preferences stored as lightweight JSON
- **Smart Reconnection**: Only reconnects when necessary
- **Memory Efficient**: Relays stored as value types

### User Experience
- **Instant Updates**: UI responds immediately to preference changes
- **Persistent State**: No need to reconfigure on each launch
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clear visual feedback for current mode
- **Educational Content**: Helps users understand privacy implications

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Relay Health Monitoring**: Track relay performance and reliability
2. **Automatic Relay Discovery**: Find and suggest new trusted relays
3. **Relay Reputation System**: Community-driven relay ratings
4. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by geographic location, performance, etc.
5. **Relay Groups**: Organize relays into logical groups

### Integration Opportunities
1. **Location Awareness**: Different relay sets for different locations
2. **Time-based Selection**: Automatic mode switching based on time
3. **Network Conditions**: Adapt relay selection based on connectivity
4. **User Patterns**: Learn from user behavior to suggest optimal settings

## ‚úÖ Completion Status

- [x] Relay categories and classification
- [x] Selection mode system
- [x] User preferences management
- [x] UI controls and configuration
- [x] Comprehensive relay management interface
- [x] Unit test coverage

## üéâ Impact

This implementation directly addresses a key privacy recommendation from the BitChat privacy assessment. Users now have complete control over which Nostr relays they use, enabling:

- **Enhanced Privacy**: Choose private/trusted infrastructure
- **Reduced Metadata**: Minimize exposure across relay networks
- **Personal Control**: Define trusted relay relationships
- **Context Awareness**: Adapt relay usage based on privacy needs

The feature demonstrates BitChat's commitment to user privacy and control while maintaining the decentralized, censorship-resistant nature of the Nostr protocol.
