A decentralized peer-to-peer messaging app that works over Bluetooth mesh networks. No internet required, no servers, no phone numbers. It's the side-groupchat for when traditional networks are unavailable.

> [!WARNING]
> Private messages have not received external security review and may contain vulnerabilities. Do not use for sensitive use cases, and do not rely on its security until it has been reviewed. Now uses the [Noise Protocol](http://www.noiseprotocol.org) for identity and encryption. Public local chat (the main feature) has no security concerns. 

## License

This project is released into the public domain. See the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## Features

- **Decentralized Mesh Network**: Automatic peer discovery and multi-hop message relay over Bluetooth LE
- **Privacy First**: No accounts, no phone numbers, no persistent identifiers
- **Private Message End-to-End Encryption**: [Noise Protocol](http://noiseprotocol.org)
- **Store & Forward**: Messages cached for offline peers and delivered when they reconnect
- **IRC-Style Commands**: Familiar `/slap`, `/msg`, `/who` style interface
- **Universal App**: Native support for iOS and macOS
- **Emergency Wipe**: Triple-tap to instantly clear all data
- **Performance Optimizations**: LZ4 message compression, adaptive battery modes, and optimized networking

## [Technical Architecture](https://deepwiki.com/permissionlesstech/bitchat)

### Binary Protocol
BitChat uses an efficient binary protocol optimized for Bluetooth LE:
- Compact packet format with 1-byte type field
- TTL-based message routing (max 7 hops)
- Automatic fragmentation for large messages
- Message deduplication via unique IDs

### Mesh Networking
- Each device acts as both client and peripheral
- Automatic peer discovery and connection management
- Store-and-forward for offline message delivery
- Adaptive duty cycling for battery optimization

For detailed protocol documentation, see the [Technical Whitepaper](WHITEPAPER.md).

## System Requirements

- iOS 16.0 or later
- macOS 13.0 or later
- Device with Bluetooth LE capability
- No internet connection required

## Setup

### Option 1: Using XcodeGen (Recommended)

1. Install XcodeGen if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   brew install xcodegen
   ```

2. Generate the Xcode project:
   ```bash
   cd bitchat
   xcodegen generate
   ```

3. Open the generated project:
   ```bash
   open bitchat.xcodeproj
   ```

### Option 2: Using Swift Package Manager

1. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   cd bitchat
   open Package.swift
   ```

2. Select your target device and run

### Option 3: Manual Xcode Project

1. Open Xcode and create a new iOS/macOS App
2. Copy all Swift files from the `bitchat` directory into your project
3. Update Info.plist with Bluetooth permissions
4. Set deployment target to iOS 16.0 / macOS 13.0

### Option 4: just

Want to try this on macOS? `just run` will set it up and run from source.  
Run `just clean` afterwards to restore things to original state for mobile app building and development.

## How It Works

BitChat creates a local mesh network using Bluetooth Low Energy technology. When users open the app, their devices automatically discover nearby BitChat users and establish connections. Messages are relayed through multiple devices in the network, allowing communication even between users who aren't directly within Bluetooth range of each other.

This makes BitChat ideal for:
- Conferences and events with poor cell reception
- Outdoor activities in remote areas
- Emergency situations where communication infrastructure is compromised
- Privacy-focused communications
- Crowded venues where cellular networks become congested

## Usage Guide

### Privacy Features
- Triple-tap anywhere to quickly clear all chat history
- All communications happen locally - no data ever leaves your device except to nearby peers
- No persistent identifiers - your identity exists only as long as the app is running

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How far can messages travel?**  
A: Messages can hop through up to 7 devices, potentially extending range significantly beyond direct Bluetooth reach.

**Q: Does BitChat work without internet?**  
A: Yes! BitChat functions entirely offline using only Bluetooth technology.

**Q: Is BitChat secure?**  
A: Public local chat is designed for convenience, not security. Private messages use the Noise Protocol but have not been externally audited.

**Q: How many people can join a BitChat network?**  
A: The practical limit depends on device density and environmental factors, but networks of dozens of users have been successfully tested.
