# Delivery Confirmation Feature Summary

## Overview
This branch implements a complete delivery confirmation system for bitchat, providing visual feedback for message delivery status and read receipts.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Delivery Status Tracking
- **DeliveryTracker.swift**: Core service managing delivery confirmations
  - Tracks pending deliveries with timeouts (30s for private, 60s for rooms)
  - Handles retries for favorite peers (up to 3 attempts)
  - Thread-safe implementation with proper lock management

### 2. Protocol Updates
- **BitchatProtocol.swift**: 
  - Added `DeliveryStatus` enum with states: sending, sent, delivered, read, failed
  - Added `DeliveryAck` structure for acknowledgments
  - Added `ReadReceipt` structure for read confirmations
  - New message types: `.deliveryAck` and `.readReceipt`

### 3. UI Implementation
- **ContentView.swift**:
  - Added `DeliveryStatusView` component showing:
    - Gray circle (○) for sending
    - Gray checkmark (✓) for sent
    - Green double checkmarks (✓✓) for delivered
    - Blue double checkmarks (✓✓) for read
    - Red triangle (⚠) for failed
  - Proper vertical alignment with message text

### 4. Message Flow
- **BluetoothMeshService.swift**:
  - Added ACK generation and sending
  - Added read receipt generation when viewing chats
  - Encrypted ACKs for privacy
  - Proper message ID handling

### 5. Critical Bug Fixes

#### Deadlock Fix
- **Issue**: macOS app freeze when sending private messages
- **Cause**: Nested lock acquisition in DeliveryTracker
- **Fix**: Restructured code to release locks before calling methods that acquire the same lock

#### Message ID Preservation
- **Issue**: ACKs referenced wrong message IDs
- **Cause**: BinaryProtocol was reading but discarding ID with `let _ =`
- **Fix**: Changed to `let id =` and passed ID to BitchatMessage constructor

## Technical Details

### Privacy Considerations
- ACKs and read receipts are encrypted end-to-end
- Only the original sender can decrypt and process them
- No message content is included in confirmations

### Performance
- Debounced UI updates (100ms)
- Efficient lock usage to prevent deadlocks
- Automatic cleanup of old delivery data

### Error Handling
- Graceful timeout handling
- Retry logic for favorites
- Clear failure messages

## Testing
See `test_delivery_confirmation.md` for comprehensive test plan.

## Future Enhancements
- Group read receipts (show who read in rooms)
- Delivery timestamps in UI
- Persistent delivery status across app restarts
- Network quality indicators
